# Bizcardx-Extracting-business-card-data-with-ocr
# Project Overview:
BizCardX is a user-friendly tool for extracting information from business cards. 
The tool uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to recognize the text on business cards and extract the data. 
The extracted data is inserted into a SQL database after classification using regular expressions. 
Users can access the extracted information using a GUI built using streamlit. 
The BizCardX application is a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. 
The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database. 
Further the data stored in database can be easily read, updated and deleted by user as per the requirement.
# Libraries used:
* EasyOCR - To extract text from images 
* streamlit - To create graphical user interface
